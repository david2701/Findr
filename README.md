# Findr

It's Tinder, for jobs.

By borrowing from Indeed search queries, this app takes input in the form of location and job type and returns a list of jobs, separated by page. On each page there's a like and dislike button, the former pushing that posting to a Saved Jobs page, which includes the job title and link to the actual application.

Built in React Native.

TODO: needs authentication for individual users and a database which matches those users to their saved jobs.
